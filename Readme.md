The script retrieves the fulltext from the articles page and modifies the "description" field of the fever database, where fever store the article data.

# Installation

The installation is very simple. Basically there are three steps to get it running:

1. Clone the latest version of the script via git or download it from github (https://github.com/daniellienert/FullFever).
2. Copy the file LocalConfiguration.Sample.php to LocalConfiguration.php and modify the MySQL Server credentials to your needs.
3. Run the script from the console or add it to a cron task right after your call the fever cron task.


No changes on the Fever application has to be done.
